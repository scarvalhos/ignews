## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Then, you need run the stripe webhooks server:

(In this case I need to download the stripe cli and add a new script to package.json to run it)

```bash
    "scripts": {
        "stripe": "stripe-cli/stripe listen  --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks",
    }
```

```bash
npm run stripe
# or
yarn stripe
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
